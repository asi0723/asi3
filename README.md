Good day, Sir!

I sincerely apologize for the late submission. I would like to respectfully inform you that the delay was due to the passing of my father. I have submitted an excuse letter regarding this matter and I hope for your kind understanding.

Thank you very much for your consideration and support.

Sincerely,

Ace Carl Dela Cruz
